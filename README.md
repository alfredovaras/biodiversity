# biodiversity

In this project, I will interpret data obtained from the National Parks Service concerning endangered species across different parks.

I will conduct a thorough analysis of the conservation statuses of these species, exploring patterns related to the types of species that face endangerment.

Throughout the project, my tasks will include analyzing, cleaning up, and visualizing data, along with formulating questions and striving to provide meaningful answers.
